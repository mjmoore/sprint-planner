Assume a story must be completable in one sprint and is not 0 effort  

Asking for a sprint does not store any data, merely returns data
Deleting a user does not remove assignments

Capacity calculation can be faulty
 2 devs with 5 points
 5 devs with 1 point
 Capacity total = 70
 Capacity used = 15
 Capacity remaining 55
 No dev available to take a 10-point story, but it is still suggested

Requirements:
  - Java 13
  - gradle 6+
